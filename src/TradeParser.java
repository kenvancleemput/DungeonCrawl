 * This class is part of the "Dungeon Crawl" application.

 * This parser reads user input and tries to interpret it as a "trade action"
 * command. Every time it is called it reads a line from the terminal and
 * tries to interpret the line as a two word command. It returns the command
 * as an object of class Action.
 *
 * The parser has a set of known action words. It checks user input against
 * the known actions, and if the input is not one of the known actions, it
 * returns an action object that is marked as an unknown action.
