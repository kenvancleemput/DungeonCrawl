 *  This class is the main class of the "Dungeon Crawl" application.
 *  "Dungeon Crawl" is a very simple, text based adventure game.  Users

 *  to make it more interesting!
 *
 *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 *  method.
 *
 *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 *  rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
 *  executes the commands that the parser returns.
